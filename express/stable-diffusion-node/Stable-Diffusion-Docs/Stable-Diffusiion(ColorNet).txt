COLOR NET FOR SAME POSES BUT DIFF OUTCOMES
Canny: Mostly for High detailed image procession OR for Anime
Depth: have less details best for creting light from diff angles
HED: creates blur outlines around special edges of image result is much similar as of canny
MLSD: mostly for straight lines EX: buildings
Normal: for mostly gaming charchetrs: EX: change iron man into transformer
OpenPose: for outspread pose (no lapping of hands, arm) and works best when person have tight clothing for visibility of arms and legs
Scribble: converts sketch like scribble into any image, anime, painting
Fake Scribble: takes real image convert it into (sketch/scribble) then into image, anime but result will be bit diff beause it first converts the image into scribble


FOR diff images merger 
put the image which position we wanted in controlnet-model-0
and the style or type in the other ones
like
image of tom cruise in controlnet-model-0 select any model
and image of an anime character in the other ones and select clip_vision and t2i_adapter_style for model
now the image of tom cruise will be in anime form
NOTE we can do this without prompt and if adding prompt then prompt must NOT be too large
slect guidance scale start for result
EX: for more of a anime image we can increase the guidance scale where the image of tom cruise is present like guidance scale start to 0.30 now the original image of
tom cruise will be 30% less becuase guidance scale start is 0.30
if we want less of anime then we can increase guidance start of the model where anime image is present
guidance start means start using images after skipping that much steps
means if guidance start scale is 0.50 then stable-diffusion will start looking image after skipping 50% of image
